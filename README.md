## Inspiration
The idea for OutwitQuiz was inspired by the growing popularity of interactive trivia games that bring people together for fun, friendly competition. We wanted to create a platform that not only challenges usersâ€™ knowledge but also allows them to outwit others with their creativity. The ability to add personal touches, such as custom answers and messages, adds a layer of personalization that makes each game unique and engaging.

## What it does
OutwitQuiz is a dynamic, real-time quiz platform where users can answer questions, submit their own answers, and compete for the top spot. Players can  earn recognition for their wit, and engage in creative banter. The app tracks results, highlights the cleverest responses, and provides a leaderboard to motivate players. It fosters a sense of community while promoting both knowledge and humor.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Taking the already existing idea of a synchronous "Psych" game and making it asynchronous and playable by a large number of people
- Managing the voting system and the algorithm to show options
